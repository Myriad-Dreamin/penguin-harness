/**
 * @prismshadow/penguin-plugin-company-proposals — proposals for company mode.
 *
 * A PLUGIN PACKAGE, not part of the harness: a Project lists it in its config and the
 * harness resolves it from the installation (see the server's plugin/loader.ts). It compiles
 * against the type-only `@prismshadow/penguin-core/plugin` and
 * `@prismshadow/penguin-server/plugin` surfaces and bundles its own copy of Hono for the
 * routes.
 *
 * A proposal is a short, abstract, paragraph-commentable account of a change: a person
 * delegates it to an employee, that employee writes it while another builds it, the person
 * reads, comments in batches and approves, and the build lands as a pull request the
 * proposal links as material. The harness lends this package what it already has — the
 * organization (its people, an employee's desk and sessions, the Project's event
 * stream), the data root — through the organization gateway; what makes those a proposal
 * lives here: the organization's relational store (schema.ts, store.ts), markdown.ts the
 * document form, service.ts the state machine and the desk deliveries that drive the
 * employees, routes.ts the reads. Every write is an Action: action-model.ts the model and the
 * slot, action-registry.ts the registry that runs them and records each run (action-store.ts),
 * builtin-actions.ts the proposal Actions, deploy.ts what a company module's deploy Action is
 * lent. The modules are plugin.ts's. The page is the web app's own `OrgProposalsPage` renderer,
 * declared as a company-mode page so it appears — with its nav row — only while the plugin is
 * installed.
