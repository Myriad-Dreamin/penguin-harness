/**
 * @prismshadow/penguin-plugin-company-roadmaps — roadmaps for company mode.
 *
 * A PLUGIN PACKAGE, not part of the harness: a Project lists it in its config and the harness
 * resolves it from the installation. It compiles against the type-only
 * `@prismshadow/penguin-core/plugin` and `@prismshadow/penguin-server/plugin` surfaces and
 * bundles its own copy of Hono for the routes.
 *
 * A roadmap is what a discussion among several employees settles into: a body written as a
 * paper, and the proposals (brief and owner, stacked on one another) and roadmaps it leads to.
 * The discussion happens in an organization channel, borrowed as it is (room.ts reads it and
 * never writes it); every employee in the room gets its desk cloned for the room — a session of
 * its own opened through the organization gateway — and the room's messages reach those
 * sessions through the session runtime (service.ts's relay). Establishing a roadmap archives it
 * and delegates each proposal to its owner, who creates it with company-proposals.
