/**
 * Every text this plugin puts on an employee's desk: the line that puts it in a roadmap's room,
 * and the lines an establishment, an approval, a link or a reopening sends.
 *
 * The room is an ordinary channel and its members take part from their desks, so the lines
 * about the room's own work carry the commands that answer them: `penguin org channel send`,
 * and the roadmap Actions (`POST …/actions/<key>/runs`) through `curl` with the session's
 * control environment (`PENGUIN_API_URL`, `PENGUIN_API_TOKEN`, `PENGUIN_PROJECT_ID`,
 * `PENGUIN_SESSION_ID`, `PENGUIN_AGENT_ID`), whose `sessionId`/`agentId` claims attribute the
 * run to the employee: the draft, the establishment, the moderator's approval of a proposal
 * item. A line about a later step — an item approved, a base linked — says only what happened
 * and what it means, with no write command; and no text anywhere tells anyone to create a
 * proposal card: the proposal of an item is created by its last approval, not by this plugin's
 * words.
