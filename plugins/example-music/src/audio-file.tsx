/**
 * The player: a linked audio file as a compact player card below the reply
 * paragraph that links it (audio-card.tsx draws it). Underneath is a plain `<audio>` without
 * controls — the browser's own player chrome differs per browser and ignores the theme — and the
 * card follows the element's media events, so the element stays the one source of truth for
 * whether it plays and where it is.
 *
 * `preload="none"` — a transcript can link many files, and nothing is fetched until the reader
 * presses play, so the length reads `-:--` and the seek bar stays off until then. The file comes
 * through the Workspace file URL, which answers the whole file (no Range requests): it plays, and
 * seeks only within what has loaded (a seek is clamped to that extent, and the bar draws it).
 *
 * A file that cannot be played — gone since the reply was written, or in a format this browser
 * does not decode — turns the card into a line saying so once playback has been tried; the link
 * above it still opens the file in the Files panel.
