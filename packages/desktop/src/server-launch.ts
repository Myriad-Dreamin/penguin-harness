/**
 * The embedded server's entry, forked by server-process.ts: the pushed CLI's server when the
 * data root has one, else the server bundled with this app (dist/server.js).
 *
 * A push carries a CLI bundle that contains the server's entry. Forking dist/server.js
 * unconditionally kept the entry this app was installed with, so a change on the entry side
 * (the process entry, the terminal WebSocket handshake) needed a new app install. Starting
 * through the pushed CLI makes it arrive with a push and a restart, as `penguin server` does
 * (packages/cli/src/server-entry.ts). Nothing pushed, or a broken record, starts the bundled
 * server: a server that starts beats one that does not.
