/**
 * Event streams: a Session's output, the user-level server events, and the machines aggregate.
 *
 * - OmniMessage uses the default event (no `event:` line); data is the message envelope as
 *   raw JSON;
 * - Server events use `event: server_event` (approval_request / task_state / resync_required /
 *   credentials_updated / hello, and `heartbeat` — the stream's own beat);
 * - The machines aggregate uses `event: machine_event`, data `{machineId, event}` — one
 *   machine's own server event, tagged with the machine it came from.
 * - A stream is a call on the page's one API socket (api/socket.ts, PRFC-0011), which
 *   re-issues it with `last-event-id` after any interruption (the server replays from its
 *   ring buffer; if the event was already evicted, it pushes resync_required instead). When
 *   the socket is not to be had, the same stream is an EventSource: the browser then
 *   auto-reconnects with the same header, and auth rides the same-origin cookie either way.
 * Docs: /docs/server-api § "Streaming (SSE)".
