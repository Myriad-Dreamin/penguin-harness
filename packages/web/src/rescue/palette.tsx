/**
 * The app's command palette: which actions exist, the shortcut that opens it (the
 * `palette.toggle` command, ⇧⌘P / Ctrl+Shift+P by default), and its words. The UI package's
 * CommandPalette is the mechanism; this file is the registry: an action here, never a new
 * global shortcut. An action opens an overlay over the current page rather than navigating —
 * closing it leaves the user exactly where they were.
 *
 * It is the way back when the UI breaks — the harness history rolls the harness version back —
 * so it mounts beside the shell's tree (app.tsx), not in it, and needs nothing the tree
 * provides: no router, no auth or Project context. It opens over the rescue panel, on the bare
 * routes, and over an open dialog (`palette.toggle` is the one command the dialog blocker lets
 * through, see lib/shortcuts/dispatcher.ts). A mounted page adds its own actions through
 * lib/palette-actions.ts.
 *
 * The palette also carries the host's commands — what the process hosting the server can do
 * on the page's behalf. Under the desktop shell that is installing the bundled `penguin`
 * command, checking for a desktop update, and opening DevTools — all of them application-menu
 * items; the menu bar is hidden there (a lone Alt used to take the keyboard), so the palette
 * is where a person finds them. The host says what it offers AND what to call it, so it can
 * offer something this build has never heard of; a plain server offers none, and a non-admin
 * is told nothing.

/**
 * What the palette shows for the host's commands.
 *
 * The host is a separate program on its own schedule — it reaches users through an installer,
 * this page through a hot push — so a host offering a command this build has never heard of
 * is the ordinary case, not the exception. It is therefore RENDERED, in the words the host
 * sent with it. A list of ids alone would have made the whole exchange pointless: the host
 * could never offer anything the page did not already carry, and reading words the page did
 * not have threw inside the actions `useMemo`, which blanked the App.
 *
 * A command this build DOES know keeps this file's words: they are translated properly and
 * carry search terms, and the page can improve them without waiting for an installer. The
 * host's words are the floor, not an instruction.
 *
 * An offer with no words at all — an older host, which sends bare ids — is shown only if this
 * build knows it. Such a host has nothing else to offer.
