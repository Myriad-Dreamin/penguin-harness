/**
 * Safe mode: the app runs without anything the server contributes, so a contribution that
 * breaks the UI can be stepped around and the harness rolled back. Four places read it: the
 * contributions consumer (shell/contributions.tsx), the boot, which assembles no plugin web
 * module (plugins/forwarded.ts — a switch that changes the tree reloads the page), the list
 * cache (lib/list-cache.ts), which draws nothing in safe mode so a bad cached list cannot break
 * the boot either, and the verified-plugin cache
 * (lib/verified-cache.ts), which it bypasses for the same reason. The rescue panel enters it,
 * the marker and the command palette leave it.
 *
 * The switch lives in sessionStorage, not in the URL. An in-app navigation drops the query
 * string, and safe mode has to hold across navigations and a reload until the user leaves it;
 * sessionStorage does that and still ends with the tab, so a forgotten safe mode does not
 * follow the user into a new one. `?safe` is the way in from outside — a typed address, or a
 * tab whose app is too broken to offer the button: the entry adopts it before the first render
 * and drops it from the address, or a reload after leaving would enter again.
 *
 * Storage can be missing or throw (a sandboxed frame, a locked-down browser); the switch then
 * lives in memory for the life of the page, which still covers everything but a reload.
