/**
 * The sidebar's nav entries and how they fold (pure decisions, unit tested). In development
 * mode every entry — New chat, then the pages below — is either PINNED, always
 * shown, or COLLAPSIBLE, inside the area a nav-row-wide chevron button under it folds away
 * (arrow up = collapse; collapsed, the button stays — arrow down — as the way back). New
 * chat, Agents, Models and Plugins are pinned by default; the user moves an entry across
 * with the row's pin button or by dragging it into or out of the collapsible area. Both
 * areas keep page order, and with nothing collapsible there is no chevron. Company
 * mode's six entries stay outside the split: they fold as one group behind the same button.
 *
 * Global storage keys, not per Project: the nav is identical everywhere, so like the
 * grouping mode (GROUP_MODE_KEY) the fold and the pin choices are single user preferences —
 * changing them anywhere changes them everywhere. Storage is injectable
 * (model-group-expansion.ts convention: vitest runs in Node, no localStorage); nothing
 * stored, unrecognized values, and throwing storage all fall back to the defaults.

/**
 * A main-nav page as the nav reads it: the shell's main-nav pages (shell/page-table.ts,
 * `navPagesOf`), passed in by the caller since they are module contributions read from the booted
 * tree. Each key names its route (`/<key>`); its title and glyph are the page's own data. Some
 * entries are admin-only and some not yet released (see below), so the sidebar renders
 * navKeysFor(pages, user.isAdmin), not the raw list. Traces is deliberately absent: reading a
 * Trace happens in the chat toolbar's panel switcher, which is the only place it happens.
 *
 * `admin`: the server refuses the page to a non-admin, so the sidebar does not offer it.
 * Machines installs software on another machine over ssh with the SERVER account's keys, which
 * `/api/machines` gates on `isAdmin` — a row that always answers 403 is worse than no row. On a
 * personal or desktop server the only account IS the admin, so nothing is hidden there.
 *
 * `released: false`: built but not yet offered. The page keeps its place — it, its route and
 * its server routes all still exist and are reachable from a test — and is simply not put in
 * front of anyone, so releasing one is flipping its contribution's flag rather than restoring
 * code.
