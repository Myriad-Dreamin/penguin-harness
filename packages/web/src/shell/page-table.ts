/**
 * The web app's pages. Each one is a contribution to the shell's `pages` slot (shell/module.ts):
 * the feature that owns it declares its route, its frame, whether it sits in the main nav,
 * whether the server refuses it to non-admins, whether it is offered yet, and its place, and
 * binds the component that draws it. `pageTableOf` turns the contributions into the table the
 * router mounts and the sidebar derives its nav group from.
 *
 * Pages a pushed platform or a plugin contributes arrive from the server (GET
 * /api/contributions) in the `PageEntry` shape, which names a renderer instead of carrying a
 * component; `contributedPages` picks the ones to mount beside this table — a page whose
 * renderer this build does not carry is skipped, since there is nothing to draw it with.
