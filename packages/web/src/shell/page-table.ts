/**
 * The web app's pages. Each one is a contribution to the shell's `pages` slot (shell/module.ts):
 * the feature that owns it declares its route, its frame, whether it sits in the main nav,
 * whether the server refuses it to non-admins, whether it is offered yet, and its place, and
 * binds the component that draws it. `pageTableOf` turns the contributions into the table the
 * router mounts and the sidebar derives its nav group from. Pages the server's modules and
 * plugins contribute are folded in after them by shell/contributions.tsx, which also drops the
 * pages the server's removals name (removedPagesOf).
