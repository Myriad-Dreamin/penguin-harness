/**
 * File renderers: how a kind of Workspace file is drawn where a reply links it. Two halves meet
 * here, which is why this is a library rather than an export of either side:
 *
 * - the RULES — which extensions take which renderer — are server contributions, state of the
 *   signed-in session: the shell's one consumer of /api/contributions validates them and provides
 *   them (shell/contributions.tsx); safe mode leaves them empty;
 * - the RENDERERS a rule may name are this build's own registry: components web modules bind to
 *   the chat module's `fileRenderers` slot under a name (features/chat/iface.ts), `audio` first.
 *
 * The conversation joins the two (features/chat/reply-files-provider.tsx).
