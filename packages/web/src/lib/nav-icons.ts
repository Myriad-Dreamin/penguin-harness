 * Which registry glyph a page wears where it is drawn outside the nav: its own header, a jump
 * action (the dock's "view trace"), a reference from another page. The nav rows themselves name
 * their glyph in the page's data (`PageData.icon`, a registry name read with `glyphOf`). The
 * drawings live in the shared registry, named for what they draw; which drawing stands for which
 * page is the app's knowledge, so the map lives here.
