/**
 * The shapes a module implements to contribute to the sidebar's slots (shell/sidebar/iface.ts):
 * a section, a work mode, a nav badge. They are a library file rather than the shell's own so
 * a contributor writes the slot key and implements the shape without importing the shell — the
 * same split as state/user-events.ts for the sessions module's handlers.
 *
 * The blocks drawn only while a mode is current — a section's `Full` and `Rail`, a mode's
 * `RailTop` — may be bound as loaders (`CodeHalf`): the sidebar defers them (shell/sidebar/
 * modes.ts) and draws them under `<Deferred>`. What is mounted for as long as the column is (a
 * section's `Scope` and `Overlays`), what every render calls (the hooks) and the marks are
 * components, loaded with the app.
