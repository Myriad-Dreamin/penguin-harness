/**
 * The chat module's interfaces. `ChatDrafts` is the seam between the chat page's drafts and the
 * surfaces that start or list them — the sidebar's New chat, the collapsed rail, the `chat.new`
 * shortcut and the session list's parked drafts. The chat module provides it (chat-drafts.ts); a
 * consumer `@Use`s it and hands it to its components through its own deps, so none of them
 * imports the chat page's draft files.
 *
 * `Chat` carries the page's slot, `sessionTabs`: tabs beside the conversation that another module
 * draws (the Agent's workflow pages), so the page names none of them.
