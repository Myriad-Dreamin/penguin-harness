/**
 * The dock's interface and its slot. A panel tab's body comes from the module that owns it — the
 * conversation's agents and memory from chat, the files from workspace, the trace, the messaging
 * binding, the scheduled tasks, the built-in browser and the port forwards from theirs — as a
 * contribution to `panels`, so the dock names none of them. A body reads the conversation it is
 * docked beside through `useChatSession()` (lib/chat-session.ts) and shows its own draft
 * placeholder (lib/dock-panel-empty.tsx).
 *
 * The interface itself carries nothing: the kernel hangs a module's slots on an interface it
 * provides (`DockSlots` beside `Dock`), and the dock module registers every contribution in the
 * panel registry (panel-registry.ts) at boot, which is what the dock's surfaces read (module.ts).
