/**
 * Keeps the dock's scope on the conversation on screen (`ShellModule.layers`, mounted once beside
 * every page). The docks belong to the conversation they were arranged in, so switching Sessions
 * switches the arrangement with it (dock-state.ts). The draft page's route id ("new" / a parked
 * draft id) is a scope of its own, handed to the Session the first send creates; pages with no
 * Session scope to a placeholder. Layout effect, not a plain one: it has to land before the chat
 * page's docks paint, or the outgoing conversation's docks flash on the incoming one.
