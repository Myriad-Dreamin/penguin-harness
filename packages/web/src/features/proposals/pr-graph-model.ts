/**
 * The PR graph's layout: the rows and lanes the graph page draws `GET …/proposals/graph` in.
 *
 * The server answers with a flat list of nodes, each naming the open PR its declared base leads to
 * (`parent`: a PR number, 0 for the base branch, null for neither — the server walks through
 * merged and closed PRs on the way) and whether that edge holds (`stacked`). The page draws it the way
 * `git log --graph` draws history — newest at the top, the base branch at the bottom, one lane
 * per branch that is still open at that height — so a straight chain is one vertical line and a
 * fork is a second lane leaving the line where it forks.
 *
 * Which child continues its parent's lane: the one that leads to the chain's top when the server
 * named one, else a child on the chain, else a stacked one, else the taller subtree, else the
 * lower PR number. Every other child takes a lane to the right, and its whole subtree is laid out
 * before the continuing child, so a side branch sits between its fork point and the rest of the
 * chain and its lanes are free again above it.
 *
 * A node with no parent (its declared base leads to no open PR and not to the base branch), or
 * that is not reached from the base at all (a cycle of declarations), cannot be drawn; the page
 * lists it apart — which is not the same as off the chain.
