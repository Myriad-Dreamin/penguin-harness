/**
 * The session list's interface and its slot. The list is a sidebar section (module.ts); what it
 * offers on its rows beyond its own actions comes from `rowActions` — the messaging binding, the
 * scheduled-task mark, the Workspace group's "Browse files" — so the list imports none of the
 * features behind them. The contributed shapes live in lib/session-row-contributions.ts.
 *
 * The interface itself carries nothing: the kernel hangs a module's slots on an interface it
 * provides (`SessionListSlots` beside `SessionList`), and the list has no API of its own to offer.
