/**
 * Frontend entry point: mounts the React root component (the frontend SPA is only
 * responsible for rendering and interaction).
 *
 * Two things happen before the mount. The module tree boots (web-root.ts): the router's pages
 * are its contributions, so there is nothing to mount until it has — it takes milliseconds once
 * it knows which plugin web modules join it (GET /api/contributions, asked at the same moment
 * as the two requests below and bounded like them), and runs alongside the reconcile below. And
 * the browser's persisted UI
 * state is reconciled against the data root the server is actually serving
 * (lib/install-scope.ts). The reconcile has to be HERE and not in a provider, because the
 * state it may clear is read from `useState` initializers scattered through the tree — the
 * sidebar's pins and order, the composer's draft — and those run during the first render. A sweep that arrived one effect later
 * would let a stale draft be read once and then deleted underneath the component holding
 * it, which is worse than either doing nothing or doing it in time. Before `createRoot`
 * there is provably no component to have read anything.
 *
 * It costs one same-origin request to the server this page was just served by, and it is
 * bounded (see syncInstallScope): it can delay the first paint, it can never prevent it.
 * `GET /api/me` — what the route guard waits on before it draws anything — is asked at the
 * same moment rather than after the mount, so the two waits overlap instead of adding up.
 * Asking it early reads nothing from the store, so it does not race the sweep.
 *
 * A boot that actually swept RELOADS instead of mounting, and does not render at all on this
 * pass — every module in the static import graph was evaluated before this file ran, so any
 * that read the store at module scope is holding keys the sweep just removed. See
 * bootInstallScope for why that is the remedy rather than making those modules lazy.
