/**
 * The user event stream's dispatch (`SessionsModule.userEvents`): the session list store reads

 * Each handler claims its own event types, so the list never names the features that listen.
 *
 * The slot hangs on the interface the sessions module provides (`UserEventHandlersSlots` beside
 * `UserEventHandlers`); a contribution names the module: `"SessionsModule.userEvents"`.
