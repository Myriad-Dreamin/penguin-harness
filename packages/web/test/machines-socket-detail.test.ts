/**
 * The Machines page's unfolded record, and the socket line in it in particular
 * (features/machines/machines-page.tsx).
 *
 * The socket fact has its own derivation (`socketReading`, machines-view.test.ts) — which state
 * reads as which word and which tone. This is the other half of acceptance: that the card
 * actually SHOWS it, with how long the state has held and the transport's own words beside the
 * word, that a socket needing attention carries the tone's ink, and that a machine with no
 * socket gets no line at all rather than a misleading "connected".
 *
 * The layer is the record component itself, rendered to static markup (react-dom/server) —
 * this package's Node environment has no DOM, but it has markup, which is the harness the
 * markdown, message-stream and field-mark tests already use. The page's own polling hands the
 * fresh fact in; nothing here renders the page or its effects.
