# What one Project lists in `[plugins]` is loaded for the whole server, so a plugin that changes
# the app for everyone gets a server of its own instead of changing it under every other spec:

#                         plugins/example-music (music-file.spec.mjs); every spec but those below
#   no-evaluation-center  plugins/example-hello-page and plugins/example-no-evaluation-center;
#                         page-removal.spec.mjs only
# E2E_PLUGIN_SET=<name> runs that set alone; unset runs both, one after the other. Which specs
# belong to which set is playwright.config.mjs's to say.
