/**
 * The CLI host's command contribution surface: discovery, ownership and dispatch.
 *
 * DISCOVERY collects the `cli.commands` data halves from the resolved module set — the
 * server package's declaration module (builtin, imported for its data alone), the CLI
 * package's own table, and the plugin closure of the data root, each package's generated
 * table read the way the server's plugin host reads it. Nothing here imports a command's
 * code: help and completion answer from the data halves alone, and the code half loads
 * only when a dispatch names one of its keys (registerPackageCommands).
 *
 * OWNERSHIP rules what a package may register. The key's root segment decides: the host
 * reserves help, version, exec, update, auth and plugin for itself, another package's key
 * owns its subtree unless the owner declared it open (the server package opens
 * `server.*`), and a package's own duplicate keys are malformed. An invalid registration
 * is ignored — it never reaches help or dispatch — and kept for `penguin plugin check` to
 * report. Two packages registering the SAME key is not an error: both stay, and the
 * invocation is the moment that says which one (the ambiguity report, exit code 2).
