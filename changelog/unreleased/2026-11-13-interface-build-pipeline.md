Interface generation now uses one compiler graph per target, with source mappings and production source roots shared by package builds and deployment. Source mappings follow package directories, with explicit aliases only for renamed entries. Re-exported interfaces and types reached through slot code remain available in the generated table. Conflicting input aliases are reported before a table is written.

Runtime interface checks reserve the TypeScript library and helper names used by their generated declarations. Core builds honor `PENGUIN_BUILD_JS_ONLY` for development and test builds; full builds continue to emit the SDK's public declarations.
